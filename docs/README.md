# Explanation

In this folder we'll put markdown files documenting harder to understand aspects of the codebase.
In the file we will index and link those markdown files and provide quick 1 line descriptions.
For example if we might have Tween.md to describe our entire tweening system.
Use your best judgement when grouping files into doc concepts.
